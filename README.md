A new tool for collecting RDP, web and VNC screenshots all in one place

This tool is still a work-in-progress and should be mostly usable but is not yet complete.
Please file any bugs or feature requests as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nccgroup/scrying/issues)

## Caveats
* Web screenshotting on Linux relies on webkit2gtk and an X server (e.g. `xvfb`)
* Web screenshotting uses the system webviews, and hiding these windows is surprisingly hard
* I haven't found a good way to take screenshots of a cocoa webview on macos - please open an issue or PR if you're interested in using this on macos and have any idea how to implement it

## Motivation
Since Eyewitness recently [dropped support for RDP](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness/issues/422#issuecomment-539690698) there isn't a working CLI tool for capturing RDP screenshots.
Nessus still works, but it's a pain to get the images out and they're not included in the export file.

I thought this was a good opportunity to write a fresh tool that's more powerful than those that came before. Check out the feature list!

## Installation
For web screenshotting, scrying currently depends on there being an installation of Chromium or Google Chrome. Install with `pacman -S chromium` or the equivalent for your OS.

Download the latest release from [the releases tab](https://github.com/nccgroup/scrying/releases). There's a Debian package available for distros that use them (install with `sudo dpkg -i scrying*.deb`), and zipped binaries for Windows, Mac, and other Linuxes.

## Usage
Grab a single web page, RDP server, or VNC server:
```
$ scrying -t http://example.com
$ scrying -t rdp://192.0.2.1
$ scrying -t 2001:db8::5 --mode web
$ scrying -t 2001:db8::5 --mode rdp
$ scrying -t 192.0.2.2
$ scrying -t vnc://[2001:db8::53]:5901
```

Run on a headless server:
```
# apt install xvfb # or OS equivalent
$ xvfb-run scrying -t http://example.com
```

Automatically grab screenshots from an nmap output:
```
$ nmap -iL targets.txt -p 80,443,8080,8443,3389 -oX targets.xml
$ scrying --nmap targets.xml
```

Choose a different output directory for images:
```
$ scrying -t 2001:db8::3 --output-dir /tmp/scrying_outputs
```

Run from a targets file:
```
$ cat targets.txt
http://example.com
rdp://192.0.2.1
2001:db8::5
$ scrying -f targets.txt
```

Run through a web proxy:
```
$ scrying -t http://example.com --web-proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
$ scrying -t http://example.com --web-proxy socks5://\[::1\]:1080
```

Image files are saved as PNG in the following directory structure:
```

├── report.html
├── rdp

│   └── 192.0.2.1-5900.png
└── web
    └── https_example.com.png
```

## Features:
Features with ticks next to them have been implemented, others are TODO
* ✔️ Automatically decide whether an input should be treated as a web address or RDP server
* ✔️ Automatically create output directory if it does not already exist
* ✔️ Save images with consistent and unique filenames derived from the host/IP
* ✔️ Full support for IPv6 and IPv4 literals as well as hostnames
* ✔️ Read targets from a file and decide whether they're RDP or HTTP or use hints
* ✔️ Parse targets smartly from Nmap and Nessus output
* ✔️ HTTP - uses platform web renderer, optionally provide paths to try on each server
* ✔️ Produces an HTML report to allow easy browsing of the results
* ✔️ VNC - supports sending auth
* ✔️ RDP - mostly working, does not support "plain RDP" mode, see [#15](https://github.com/nccgroup/scrying/issues/15)
* ✔️ Customise size of captured images (web & RDP; VNC does not generally allow this)
* Proxy support - SOCKS works for RDP. Web is currently broken pending [inclusion of the set_proxy command in webkit2gtk](https://github.com/gtk-rs/webkit2gtk-rs/issues/81) [#11](https://github.com/nccgroup/scrying/issues/11)
* Video streams - tracking issue [#5](https://github.com/nccgroup/scrying/issues/5)
* option for timestamps in filenames
* Read targets from a msf services -o csv output
* OCR on RDP usernames, either live or on a directory of images
* NLA/auth to test credentials
* Parse Dirble JSON output to grab screenshots of an entire website - waiting for [nccgroup/dirble#51](https://github.com/nccgroup/dirble/issues/51)
* Full cross-platform support - tested on Linux and Windows; Mac support has been deprioritised pending good ideas for screenshotting the cocoa webview
